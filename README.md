**About**

This project explores player and team performance in the 2024–2025 NBA season. The analysis answers questions like:
- How do three-point attempts relate to total points scored?
- Which teams have the highest average field-goal percentages?
- How are field-goal percentages distributed across players?

**Key Findings**
- **3PA vs Total Points:** More 3-point attempts generally lead to higher total points, but some high scorers rely on 2-point shots.  
- **Top Teams by FG%:** Denver Nuggets and Memphis Grizzlies had the highest average field-goal percentages, while Washington Wizards and Brooklyn Nets had the lowest average field-goal percentages.
- **FG% Distribution:** Most players cluster around 40–50% FG%, with a few outliers. 

**Data Source**

The dataset used in this project was obtained from basketball-reference.com for the 2024–2025 NBA season.
